label {
	margin-right: .3em;
	width: 6.3em;  /* I made this deliberately wide – come up with your own optimal width */
	display: inline-block; /* width will not work for “inline” elements such as “label”. Therefore we need to set it to “inline-block” */
}

To remove the bullet points, we set list style to none:

/* we place the id formcol1 in front of the li element in order to limit this formatting to the top part of the form */

#formcol1 li {   
	list-style:none;
}
